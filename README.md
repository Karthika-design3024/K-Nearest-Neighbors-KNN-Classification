# ðŸŒ¸ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier - AI & ML Internship Task

This repository contains the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for a classification problem using the Iris dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Task Objective
- Understand and implement KNN for classification problems.
- Visualize decision boundaries and evaluate model performance.

## ðŸ“¦ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Iris dataset from scikit-learn library.

## ðŸš€ Instructions
1. Install the required libraries:
    ```
    pip install scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```
2. Run the `knn_classification.py` file to see results.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Learnings
